#### Notes

1. Engineer Status:
   - Engineers use an `is_active` flag (0 or 1) to indicate their status
   - All list endpoints return only active engineers by default (`is_active = 1`)
   - Unlike users which use `deleted_at` for soft deletion, engineers are managed through the active flag

2. Coach Assignments:
   - Active assignments are indicated by `is_active = 1`
   - When ending an assignment, it's marked as inactive rather than being deleted

### Evaluation Management APIs (`/api/evaluations`)

#### `/api/reports/batch-stats` Parameters

Query Parameters:
- `year` (number): Year for the report (e.g., 2024)
- `quarter` (string, optional): Quarter filter (Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4)
- `engineer_ids` (string): Comma-separated list of engineer IDs (e.g., "21,22,23")
- `start_date` (string, optional): Start date in ISO format
- `end_date` (string, optional): End date in ISO format

Response includes:
- `overall_stats`: Combined statistics for all selected engineers
- `quarterly_stats`: Statistics broken down by quarter
- `individual_stats`: Individual statistics for each engineer
- `monthly_data`: Monthly breakdown for each engineer

#### Rate Limiting

The reports API has a dedicated rate limiter:
- 2000 requests per minute per IP
- More lenient than the general API rate limit (1000 requests per 30 seconds)

#### Notes

1. The `/api/reports/batch-stats` endpoint is the recommended way to fetch report data as it:
   - Reduces the number of API calls needed
   - Uses comma-separated engineer IDs for better URL compatibility
   - Returns all necessary data in a single response

2. The following endpoints are deprecated and will be removed in future versions:
   - `/api/reports/stats`
   - `/api/reports/my-team`
   - `/api/reports/engineer/:id`
   - `/api/reports/quarterly`
   - `/api/reports/monthly`

3. For large reports, consider using pagination or limiting the number of engineers to prevent timeouts.
